# Player Transaction Calculator

I like to play games like Monopoly with my kids, but they are young and since players tend to spend 80% of the time counting money they grow tired quickly.

### Transaction Calculator

This is a helpful utility to track transactions between players. It is meant to be played on a touch enabled device with access to a browser.

### Features

1. Easily create transactions between players
2. Keeps receipt of recent transactions for each player
2. Undo transaction capability
3. Stateful - if the device crashes or the page is accidently reloaded, the session can be restored. It would be a bad day if near the end of a good game, the ledger is accidently destroyed.

### Details

* Written in Angular.js
* Just practice early in my exposure to Angular.js
* Not intended to be example of best practices - it was just done for fun and practice (plus, my kids hate contant counting play money)
